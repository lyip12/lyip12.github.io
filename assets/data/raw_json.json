            "Comments": "For most of the early twentieth century, Mattapan was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood at the southern edge of Dorchester. During the late 1960s and 1970s, due in part to Boston Banks Urban Renewal Group (B-BURG), redlining and blockbusting led to white flight from the area. Mattapan’s black community grew during the 1970s, and since the 1980s, Mattapan has been home to an increasingly ethnically diverse black community, including especially immigrants from Haiti and the Caribbean. This 2005 sculpture, designed by former Mattapan residents and cousins Fern Cunningham and Karen Eutemey, serves as a gateway to Mattapan. The pair of nineteen foot statues celebrate the diverse history of Mattapan, including its Native American (Mattahunt), Jewish, German, Irish, African-American and Caribbean origins.",

            "Comments": "In 1989, a group of Haitian-American health care professionals created the Haitian American Public Health Initiative to address the needs of Boston’s Haitian community. Although foreign born people of African descent have always been a significant part of greater Boston’s black community - since 1900, at least 10% of all black people in the city have been born outside of the United States - Haitian migration to the region during the 1970s and 1980s provided Boston with the third largest Haitian-American population in the country. Designed to meet the language, cultural, and public health needs of Haitian Americans across greater Boston, HAPHI has been a pioneer in culturally appropriate healthcare, education, and advocacy that meets the needs of the community.",

The goal was to create an interracial, interfaith center to fight for neighborhood improvement, better schools, and racial cooperation. In 1952, Freedom House moved to 14 Crawford Street in Grove Hall, although a devastating fire forced it to its “new” facility at 5 Crawford Street in 1961. Since then, Freedom House has been the site of countless political and civil rights struggles, including the fight for “racially balanced” public schools in the 1960s and 1970s.",

            "Comments": "During the 1940s, a local group of black musicians organized one of Boston's first Muslim communities of African descent. In 1957, early followers of the Nation of Islam’s Elijah Muhammad established Mosque No. 11 in an old Synagogue on Intervale Street in Dorchester. Malcolm X, who lived in Roxbury with his sister after his release from prison, ministered at Mosque No. 11 and considered it his home. Louis Farrakhan also ministered at the mosque and lived in the adjoining property, 37 Intervale Street. After X’s assassination in 1965, the Mosque, like others across the country, entered a period of transformation. This was in large part due to the fact that in 1976, when Nation of Islam founder, Elijah Muhammad, passed away, his son, Imam Warith Deen Mohammed, declared that all Nation of Islam followers should convert to Al-Islam. Mosque No. 11 made this conversion, and subsequent leaders, including Imam Shakir Mahmoud, renamed the Mosque Masjid Al-Quran. Presently, Mosque 11 Masjid Al-Quran keeps its doors open to the community of 70,000 Muslims who live and worship in Boston, and members come from all over the city.",

Born in Boston to Caribbean immigrant parents, and raised in a household that followed the black nationalist philosophy of Marcus Garvey, Lewis attended Emerson College and Boston University. The school she founded in 1950 provided arts education for black and brown children across Roxbury and the South End. In 1968, she created the National Center of Afro-American Artists as an institution “committed to preserving and fostering the cultural arts heritage of black peoples worldwide.” The adjoining museum, which was established at a later date, “is dedicated to the celebration, exhibition, collection, and criticism of black visual arts heritage worldwide.” The center currently operates the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists which displays and supports work by artists across the global African diaspora.",

Under the pediment was set a gorgeous rosette stained glass window,” wrote Heath. The church was built at a cost of $115,000, which included 15 stained-glass windows designed and made by the Boston master glass artisan Charles Connick, according to Heath. Construction of the church finished in 1917. After the church was shut down and sold, 11 windows were moved to the Sacred Heart Church in Weymouth in 2007. The church campus was controversially closed in 2004 and was bought by the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation (JPNDC) and New Atlantic Development in 2005. The campus has been redeveloped over the years, including the rectory building being put on wheels to move and become condos. The convent became housing and the Norbert School has plans to become 21 apartment units. A mixed-use building was also built at the corner of Creighton and Centre Streets.",

Originally positioned in the center of a large rural estate, the Kittredge House was also once home to prominent 19th century Boston architect Nathaniel Bradlee. In the 1970s and 80s, it was home to the African American advancement organization Roxbury Action Program (RAP). The house was vacant from 1991-2011. HBI purchased the property in 2011 and completed a $3.8 million rehabilitation in 2014. The renewed mansion now holds five two-bedroom residential units including two permanently designated affordable units.",

Born in Curryville, Georgia in 1887, Roland Hayes was the son of formerly enslaved parents, Fanny and William Hayes. Roland was a singer as a child, and studied music at Fisk University, where he performed with the Fisk Jubilee Singers. After touring the world, including in London where King George and Queen Mary of England requested that he perform for them privately, Hayes returned to the United States and married Helen A. Mann. He settled in Boston in 1911, and later taught at Boston University. After receiving many awards and honors, including the 1924 NAACP Springarn Medal, Hayes performed for the final time at the Longy School of Music in Cambridge in 1973. He died in 1977 in Boston and is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery.",

In 1901, when the elevated streetcar opened in Dudley Square, the area became a hub of commercial, cultural, and political activity in the racially mixed, yet increasingly black, section of Roxbury. The 1995 mural, “Faces of Dudley,” was painted by Mike Womble and a group of teen artists, and was rehabbed by Womble in 2015. In addition to images of renowned residents such as Malcolm X (1925-1965) and Melnea Cass (1896-1978), every other portrait in the mural is a portrait of a neighborhood resident.",

From 1944, when the school changed its name to Boston Technical High School through its collaboration with Mario Umana Technical High School in 1989, John D. O’Bryant has educated generations of young people across Roxbury.",

Although congregants were primarily from the Caribbean, the church also served African Americans and foreign born people of African descent. Services began in the building in 1924; the congregation was named after Cyprian, the Bishop of Carthage in North Africa.",

            "Comments": "As quickly as the Back Bay developed, another problem festered. A mill company's dam's basin became an increasingly noxious open sewer, particularly at low tide. Even then, pollution was a problem, and Bostonians demanded a solution. Enter Frederick Law Olmsted. He proposed to flush out the stagnant waterway and add naturalistic plantings to emulate the original tide marsh ecology of the Fenway area. His plan was true to both the character of the land and the needs of the growing population. Today we find in the Fens different charms from the ones Olmsted created. The 1910 damming of the Charles River changed the water here from brackish to fresh, rendering his plantings unsupportable. Only two of the original \"strong but unobtrusive\" bridges, the parks general boundaries and some early trees remain of Olmsted's design. The Fens continues to be much loved and utilized. Community gardens; the elegant Kellecher Rose Garden; World War II, Korean and Vietnam War memorial; busy ball fields; and the unusual range of bird species are major attractions.",

            "Comments": "In 1968, Boston racial justice activist, Mel King (b. 1928), led a group of community organizers in a four day occupation to protest the city’s urban renewal policy. The Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) planned to transform a lot that had been cleared by the city into a parking garage; as many as 100 families were displaced in the initial clearing and there was still great need for affordable housing in the working-class, predominantly black neighborhood. The Tent City occupation attracted support from activists and celebrities, including Celtics player and coach, Bill Russell, who fed the activists as they set up small tents on the lot. Despite multiple arrests, organizers formed the Tent City Task Force (later named the Tent City Corporation), which eventually forced the city to create the Tent City Housing Complex in 1988. Presently, the Tent City Housing Complex is a mixed income development.",

            "Comments": "When Back Bay Station opened in 1899, African Americans represented nearly a third of the population surrounding Columbus Avenue and Dartmouth Street on the Albany Railroad. This population concentration was a result of the black community’s migration from Beacon Hill to Back Bay and the adjoining South End. Many men in these neighborhoods worked as Pullman Porters on interstate trains throughout the Northeast. During the 1910s, these porters organized in protest against discrimination and exploitative pay, which attracted the attention of Harlem activist A. Philip Randolph, who later founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP). The Brotherhood was established in 1925 and formally recognized as a union in 1937. In 1986, as part of the state’s Southwest Corridor project, artist Tina Allen was commissioned to design this statue for Back Bay Station to commemorate Randolph and the local black community’s contribution to the BSCP. The station concluded renovations in 1987.",

As the first African-American theologian appointed dean of a predominantly white institution, Thurman introduced non-violent theology to the Boston University community, including doctoral candidate Martin Luther King Jr. As a mentor to Dr. King and a committed civil rights activist in his own right, Thurman studied Quaker, Hindu, and Christian theology, and published over twenty books on philosophy and Christian theology, including the popular Jesus and the Disinherited.",

            "Comments": "Boston’s Seaport District along the waterfront of South Boston has undergone a dramatic shift in recent years, evolving from acres and acres of windswept parking lots to a city-within-a-city filled with hotels, restaurants, nightlife destinations, brew pubs, an art museum, a federal courthouse, a cinema and more. For more than a century, though, the Boston Fish Pier—the country’s oldest working edifice of its kind—has stood as a reminder of the area’s seagoing past. Begun in 1910 and originally known as Pier 6, Boston Fish Pier was slated to replace the smaller, downtown piers that had been the center of the fishing industry in the Hub. Two years later, two large buildings were constructed along opposite sides of the pier to house fish dealers and other related marine businesses, along with an administration and auction building at the end of the pier. The structure also housed an eight-story cold storage facility, since demolished along with a bygone power plant, that was said to have been the largest in the world. When the Fish Pier made its official debut, it contained berths for 40 fishing vessels, with the capacity to have more than 80 boats unload simultaneously. For much of the 20th century, the fishing business at the pier was booming, peaking in 1963 with a total catch of 339 million pounds.",

            "Comments": "Mixed in with modern high-rise buildings, this building looks more like it belongs in medieval Europe than in Boston, but it once served an important role in the city’s history. It was one of many National Guard armories built across the state in the late 1800s, and it bears some resemblance to Springfield’s state armory, which was built around the same time. The Armory of the First Corps of Cadets was built between 1891 and 1897, and like many other prominent civic buildings in late 19th century Boston it was designed by William Gibbons Preston, whose other works included Mechanics Hall and the Museum of Natural History. Although the castle-like building seems somewhat whimsical in appearance, it actually served a very practical purpose; in the event of riots or other civil unrest, it would be able to withstand any attacks. The tower could even be used to exchange signals with officials at the Massachusetts State House, which is located on the other side of Boston Common.",

Griffiths’ \"Birth of a Nation,\" the popular film that glorified the southern Ku Klux Klan. During the protests, many black activists, including Trotter, were arrested after the city’s Mayor, James Michael Curley (1874 - 1958), initially refused to censor the film. Trotter’s public protest inspired similar NAACP-led demonstrations across the country.",

She began her career as a concert pianist, but after her marriage to Dr. Henry Harris Beach, she turned her talents to composition. When her Mass in E flat major, which took three years to complete, was performed by the Handel and Haydn Society with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in February 1892, it was the first work by a woman to be performed by the Society. In the same year her aria for an alto soloist was the first work by a woman to be performed by the New York Symphony Orchestra. Her standing as a composer led her to be commissioned to write the Festival Jubilate for chorus and orchestra which was played at the dedication of the Woman’s Building during Chicago’s 1892 World’s Columbia Exposition. Beach’s Gaelic Symphony was performed by orchestras throughout the country. In 1900, she premiered her own piano concerto with the Boston Symphony and later performed it in Europe. In addition to her larger pieces, Beach composed choral works, piano pieces, and over 150 popular songs.",

It was located on the second floor of an annex to the next-door Adams House hotel. It replaced an earlier theatre in the same building that at various times was called the Lion, the Mechanics Institute, the Melodeon Varieties, the New Melodeon, and the Gaiety. B.F. Keith took over the Bijou Theatre in 1886 and began to stage vaudeville shows there. Later he converted it to show movies and renamed it the Bijou Dream Theatre. At one point it was also called the Intown Theatre. The Bijou Theatre continued operating into the 1940’s, but after the horrific Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire of 1942, Boston enacted stricter fire laws that doomed the Bijou Theatre. Its exits led not to the street but rather to two neighboring theatres, the old BF Keith Theatre (later called the Normandie Theatre and the Laffmovie Theatre) and the newer Keith Memorial Theatre (much later called the Savoy Theatre and the Boston Opera House). Eventually the Bijou Theatre was razed to the orchestra and stage floors, which became the roof of the stores below.",

Griffith's racist film \"Birth of a Nation.\" In 2007, America's first African-American president, Barack Obama, held a political rally at the bandstand with Massachusetts' first African-American Governor, Deval Patrick. Most famously, on April 23, 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke from the bandstand to a crowd of over 22,000 people involved in city-wide protests against segregated housing, unequal public schools, and deeply entrenched economic inequality across greater Boston.",

            "Comments": "The Public Garden opened in 1837 as a private space, but grew into a public park with its lagoon, swan boats, seasonal plantings, fountains, and sculpture. Make Way for Ducklings, modeled on the ducklings in Robert McCloskey’s book of the same name, is by local sculptor, Nancy Schön. Women also designed the sculptures for four fountains in the Public Garden. Beginning with the ducklings, follow the path to the left to Triton Babies by Anna Coleman Ladd (1878-1939), given by Elizabeth Sturgis Grew Beal. Continue to Bagheera by Lillian Swann Saarinen. Named for the panther in Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book, it was given to the garden by friends of the sculptor. Cross the bridge over the lagoon to the Arlington Street entrance. On your right is Small Child by Mary Moore (1881-1967), the gift of Margaret Tenney Tozzer. On your left is Boy and Bird by Bashka Paeff (1893-1979), a Russian immigrant who studied at the Museum School and gave the sculpture to the Public Garden. Note: Thomas Ball’s sculpture of Charles Sumner. Although Anne Whitney’s model won the blind competition, the Boston Arts committee rejected it when they learned that the sculptor was a woman, choosing Ball’s instead. Whitney later installed her version in Harvard Square in 1902.",

The Arcand Automotive Repair Company purchased this former depot in 1969, initially intending to relocate their Allston business to this site. Instead, owner Eugene J. Arcand converted the building to restaurant use, opening the \"Allston Depot Steak House\" in 1972. This restaurant use survives today under the same ownership, although now targeted to a sports-minded clientele under the name \"Sports Depot.",

            "Comments": "Robert G. Shaw was the only son of Francis George and Sarah Blake (née Sturgis) Shaw. Robert Gould Shaw was an American officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Born into a prominent Boston abolitionist family, he accepted command of the first all-black regiment in the Northeast. SHaw himself was white. The Shaws were a wealthy and well connected New York and Boston family. They were also radical abolitionists and Unitarians. The Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial, located across Beacon Street from the State House, serves as a reminder of the heavy cost paid by individuals and families during the Civil War. In particular, it serves as a memorial to the group of men who were among the first African Americans to fight in that war. Although African Americans served in both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, northern racist sentiments kept African Americans from taking up arms for the United States in the early years of the Civil War. However, a clause in Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation made possible the organization of African American volunteer regiments. The first documented African American regiment formed in the north was the Massachusetts 54th Volunteer Infantry, instituted under Governor John Andrew in 1863. African American men came to enlist from every region of the north, and from as far away as the Caribbean. Robert Gould Shaw was the man Andrew chose to lead this regiment.",

McGuire (1866 - 1934) founded the African Orthodox Church (AOC) in 1921, upon appointment as Bishop by the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Located at this site in Cambridge, St. Augustine’s Church held AOC services that supported the pan-Africanist philosophy of Marcus Garvey. McGuire had moved to the area in the early 1900s to study medicine at the Boston College of Physicians and Surgeons. Although McGuire was ordained in the Episcopal Church, soon after his arrival in the U.S., he became disenchanted with the racism of the predominantly white denomination and founded the predominantly West Indian St. Bartholomew’s Church in Cambridge, MA. Although the relationship between McGuire and Garvey ultimately ended in the 1920s, McGuire continued to lead local African descended people, both West Indian and native born, as the AOC expanded to thirty churches, fifty clergy, and 30,000 members across the Americas and Africa.",

As Governor, Patrick oversaw the implementation of Massachusetts’ healthcare reform legislation when the State became the first in the country to mandate universal healthcare for its citizens. This law became the basis for the Federal Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.",

            "Comments": "Built in 1890, the Ames Building was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge and stood as Boston’s tallest building at the time. Upon its completion, the building became a prominent office location in Boston's growing financial district and its height offered Bostonians a unique vantage point of the city, the roof being a popular tourist attraction. Creating a building style unique to its time, the structure blended Romanesque and Byzantine architectural styles and incorporated a masonry façade of blue slate and red sandstone details along with decorative carvings. In 1974 the Ames Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1993 it was designated a Boston Landmark, a measure the Alliance vocally supported. After purchasing the building in 2007, Normandy Real Estate Partners and Ames Hotel Partners transformed the empty building into one of Boston's newest boutique hotels, currently operated by Morgans Hotel Group. Respecting the historic character of the building, the project included skillful restoration of the exterior masonry façade, window surrounds and moldings, and careful restoration of the lobby's vaulted mosaic-tiled ceiling",

            "Comments": "In 1815 white businessman Abiel Smith died and bequeathed $4,000 for the education of African American children in Boston. The Abiel Smith School, located at 46 Joy Street, was constructed between 1834 and 1835. It was built by the City of Boston to house the African School and was one of the earliest buildings designed by architect Richard Upjohn. Starting in 1787, many black Bostonians fought tirelessly against the inequality and discrimination in public schools. At that early date, numerous community members, including Prince Hall, petitioned the state legislature claiming that it was unjust for their taxes to support the education of white children when the city had no school for black children. However, a small number of African American children did attend the city’s white schools in the early 1800s. In 1798, sixty members of the black community organized the African School in order to educate their children. This school first met in the home of Primus Hall. It moved into the first floor room of the African Meeting House in 1808. At this date, the African American children who were enrolled in Boston public schools moved their enrollment to the African School. In 1812, the Boston School Committee finally became worn down by decades of petitions and requests; they officially recognized the African School and started providing partial funding ($200 yearly), but the condition of this school remained poor and space was inadequate.",

Although Walker lived here only briefly (1827 - 1829), he supported black-led abolition in Boston until his death in 1830, including the Massachusetts General Colored Association (predecessor to William Lloyd Garrison’s New England Anti-Slavery Society), and the early black feminism of fellow abolitionist, Maria Stewart (1803 - 1879). Stewart - the first woman in the United States to deliver a public speech on a political subject - resided here after Walker’s death, during the early 1830s.",

In 1873, they formally opened St. Paul’s, originally located at the corner of Portland and Hasting Streets. Today, the Church remains one of the largest and most significant African American congregations in the region.",

It is one of the oldest commercial buildings extant in downtown Charlestown, and it housed the first office of Charlestown's first regular newspaper, the Bunker Hill Aurora. Furthermore, it was built and occupied by one of Charlestown's early and prominant families. The Austin Block building was erected by 1827 when the Bunker Hill Aurora began printing its earliest editions from their upper floor quarters. Early occupants of the building, according to the first Charlestown directory, published in 1831, (and giving the original address of 85 Main Street), were George Johnson's West Indian goods store on the first floor, and upstairs, the Bunker Hill Aurora office, plus offices for several members of the Austin family. General Nathaniel Austin, Sheriff of Middlesex County, had his office and living quarters here at that time.",

Although Colonel George Washington initially prevented African descended people from serving in the Continental Army, many black men across New England joined local military companies that rallied in support of the Revolution. Some of these men were no doubt familiar with Buckman Tavern (est. 1709 - 1710), the first public house in Lexington, and a favorite gathering place for militia men during their training on the nearby Lexington Green. In 1773, an enslaved man, Prince Estabrook (c. 1741 - 1830) enlisted in the Lexington militia. Estabrook fought alongside his fellow colonists at the famous Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Estabrook's story is memorialized on a plaque outside the tavern.",

Caesar Robbins (b. 1745), the family patriarch, was enslaved in Chelmsford and served in both the French and Indian, and the Revolutionary War. Two of his six children, Susan and Peter, were the first residents of the house. His granddaughter, Ellen Garrison Jackson, was born in the house in 1823, supported abolitionist and women’s rights in Boston, and worked as a teacher in Freedmen’s Schools in the U.S. South during the early days of Reconstruction.",

            "Comments": "City Hall is just one — though perhaps the most notable — example in a wave of major brutalist buildings constructed in Boston in the 1960s. The city had been suffering from a period of decline during the early- to mid-20th century. However, the Boston Redevelopment Authority, flush with public investment, was hoping to reinvigorate the city’s urban center. Boston City Hall, as well as City Hall Plaza and the rest of Government Center, replaced the run-down neighborhood of Scollay Square.The city went on an international contest to select the design for Boston’s “New City Hall.” After receiving a total of 256 entries, a panel of judges picked the winning design, a collaboration between Gerhard Kallmann, Noel McKinnell and Edward Knowles, in May 1962. Brutalism as a style began to fall out of favor in the 1970s. Experts attribute a variety of potential reasons. Abramson notes that concrete as a material can appear “off-putting,” “overbearing,” and “indecipherable.”",

The Asylum was incorporated in 1877 and opened in 1880. The purchase of the Jamaica Plain estate of J. Gardiner Weld, a commercial merchant who died c. 1876 prior to inhabiting his new mansion, was made possible by Seth Adams, who made his fortune at his sugar refinery in South Boston that had begun in 1858. The Adams brothers (Seth and Isaac) previously had manufactured printing presses and machinery. Seth Adams at his death bequeathed $600,000 for establishment of a curative institution for the benefit of indigent, debilitated, nervous people, inhabitants of the State who are not insane.",
