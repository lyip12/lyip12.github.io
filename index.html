            <p>The project began by thinking about personal memories embed meaning into objects and moved into a discussion of how objects are used to build collective memory, a collective history, a sense of progression to the present and a common vision for the future. Public symbols such as monuments, landmarks are generally built by the state and can be reflective or even manipulative in building a story. They create belonging and collectivity.  They can also exclude and alienate.<br><br>In recent years there has been a revisiting of monuments in the US, the most publicized in Charlottesville, where hundreds of white supremacists and Nazis staged a torch-lit march that set off a weekend of violence in 2017. The rally was originally organized to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park and drew about 600 participants who later clashed with protesters form the left, resulting in several injuries and the death of a young woman.  Professor of architectural history Louis Nelson notes the confederate monuments, built in the 1920s: “They are victory monuments, unflinching testaments to the collapse of Reconstruction and the re-establishment of white supremacy. And as public art they inscribed that victory into the fabric of the city.<br><br>Malgorzata Kalinowska who studies psychology and memory notes monuments allow “individuals living within a society to participate in a shared cultural space and contain their individual historical experience within its particular set of symbols and signs.” Louis Nelson states that monuments can also be carefully constructed to promote free and equal citizenship “for the state to speak out in favor of ideas of equality and tolerance and condemn those of inequality and intolerance.”<br><br><b>In Boston, citizens are also rethinking public space, memory and inclusion. A confederate monument was removed from public space, in the wake of Charlottesville.  What does it say about public memory that of more than 70 statues in public spaces only four honour women?  A bright pink piece of paper taped to a monument in front of the university’s Wadsworth House reminds us of who is missing from public history and what stories are being hidden from collective memory. It reads: “This house was also a place of enslavement. Among those held in bondage in this building were: Titus, Venus, Juba, Bilhah.” As it turns out the note came from The Harvard and Slavery Project which began in 2007 to reclaim this history.  Similarly can the annual vandalizing of statues of Columbus, with red paint and slogans of genocide be understood as subversive discourse in a public narrative that excludes Indigenous peoples and colonialism?  Is there irony in a monument memorializing the Massachusetts 54th Regiment, it’s first all African- American regiment, should be named for Colonel Robert Gould Shaw a white man? Our project looks at how Boston is using space, particularly gender and race in public memory, and asks how might public the space be reformed to build a more inclusive collective memory.</b>

The walk features women across the centuries, with a focus on the eighteenth century through the mid-nineteenth century. It includes women who wrote poetry, essays, and plays and spoke out publicly before members of the Massachusetts State Legislature and in Boston’s halls and churches for the abolition of slavery, woman suffrage, and African American and Native American rights. Boston’s downtown area is home to its business and financial institutions, as well as to a major shopping area and the Quincy Market at Faneuil Hall.</p>

                    <p><br>The Beacon Hill Walk begins at the Massachusetts State House with the statues of two seventeenth century women religious dissenters. The walk continues up, down, and across Beacon Hill, often paralleling the Black Heritage Trail. Starting with intense activity in the period before and after the Civil War and continuing into the nineteenth century, women writers and artists living here supported social movements ranging from anti-slavery to suffrage. The walk pays particular attention to the story of Beacon Hill’s African American women and of Boston’s first women doctors and professional nurses. Beacon Hill is a designated Historic District with narrow, steep, sometimes cobblestone streets, and brick homes featuring beautiful doorways and window boxes. It was first developed by the Mount Vernon Proprietors in 1795. Charles Street along its western edge includes antique and specialty shops, restaurants, and grocery stores.</p>

                    <p><br>The Back Bay, originally a mudflat, was filled in with gravel brought from suburban Needham by train between 1852 and 1890. The land is flat, with streets laid out in a straight grid. The cross streets are conveniently named alphabetically from A to H. This elegant neighborhood includes Commonwealth Avenue with its tree-lined mall of grass, center walking path, and sculptures, as well as the “uptown” shopping area with high-end stores, art galleries, and restaurants. The Back Bay East Walk starts and ends at the Public Garden. The sites highlight the work of women in the arts and in education, and women who led the way in environmental protection, suffrage, and peace.</p>
